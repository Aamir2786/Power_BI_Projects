Implementing analytical project

## Maven Crowdfunding Challenge

### About the dataset 
- Weâ€™re looking at over 375,000 projects started on Kickstarter [https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-crowdfunding-challenge](url)
- Each record represents one project
- Records contain details about the project category, deadline date, amount pledged, number of backers, and more!

### How to play the Maven Crowdfunding Challenge
- For this challenge, I will be assuming the role of an analyst at an investment firm that invests in early stage entrepreneurs. The partners have asked you to analyze -Kickstarter projects to understand factors that lead to a project taking off.

- The task is to share a single-page visual or dashboard that provides data-driven recommendations for the types of projects they should be looking at for future success.

### Airbnb:
* Done:
  major differences in the Airbnb market between cities
* Need to figure out:
  Prices which are in local currency, attributes have the biggest influence in price, trends or seasonality in the review data and which city offers a better value for travel.
